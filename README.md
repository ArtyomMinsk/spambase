Classify spam using the Spambase dataset. Python module `scikit-learn`

## Description

This project is about supervised machine learning model (Train/Test) that uses labeled data to predict outputs based on inputs. The task is to classify the data from the Spambase dataset into spam and not-spam, training with training data and testing on test data.  This is done with `sklearn.cross_validation` module.

## Motivation

The motivation of this project is to:

- Understand simple Bayesian analysis
- Understand the importance of separating training and test data
- Be able to create a Bayesian classifier
- Be able to train your classifier
- Be able to test your classifier
